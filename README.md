The purpose of this repository is to transform source data into a required format for data insight generation. The repository includes source data and Jupyter Notebook as well as the transformed data.

Source data "tables: Employment supplementary data tables, 2020” is part of the “People with disability in Australia” collection by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The data contains 12 data tables related to people with a disability and their engagement in labour force in Australia.

The Jupyter Notebook is a written Python program language that reads the youth unemployment data to transform into a required format for data insight generation.
